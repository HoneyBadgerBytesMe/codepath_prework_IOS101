## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    1.Xcode Compatibility: My Mac no longer supports the latest Xcode version, so I had to find alternative methods to download it. I ended up renting an online virtual machine for this project. I'm planning to purchase a new Mac Mini for future development.

    2.Navigating Xcode: As a new user, I had to familiarize myself with Xcode’s interface and features, which took time to learn.

    3.Button Functionality Issue: The "Change Background" button code wasn’t working initially. I spent 30 minutes watching a walkthrough on YouTube and discovered that the app was running in a different tab from where the code was written, which caused the problem. Once I aligned the correct tabs, the function worked.
